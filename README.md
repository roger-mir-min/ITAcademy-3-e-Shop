# ITAcademy-3-eShop
A simple page for an e-commerce.

## Background
Result of Sprint 4 at IT Academy.

## Installing
1. Clone the repository https://github.com/roger-mir-min/ITAcademy-3-e-Shop.git
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage
The user can add product to the chart clicking "Add to cart" on a product card. The "cart" number at the top-right corner will be updated. When clicking "cart", the cart modal will be opened and will display cart details (products, quantity, price, total price), but the payment process won't go further. The form part has validators, but doesn't really submit the data. The authentication part is just for decorative purposes.
